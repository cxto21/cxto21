# OSI and TCP/IP models
The TCP/IP model is the most widely used framework today for packets traveling over the Internet. It begins to be used in 1982, after a few years of ARPANET.
The OSI Model was invented to group and work different protocols of uses and recognized segments in network communications. Currently the OSI Model is mainly used to study Networks, distributed systems, their uses and their applications in a guided way. The OSI Model also allows us to recognize different problems and limitations between layers, such as those related to address scalability problems and transmission bottlenecks. The OSI Model has 7 Layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and the Physical layer. In a "top down" approach it starts from the Application layer and last to the Physical layer.
